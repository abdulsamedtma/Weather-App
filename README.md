# Weather App



The weather app is a web application that provides real-time weather information for cities worldwide. It offers a user-friendly interface with a search bar to input city names. After searching, users can view the current weather, including city name, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A search history feature allows users to revisit previous city weather data. The app's design is responsive and adaptable to various devices. Upon visiting the app, users are greeted with a clean and visually appealing layout. The main section of the app includes a search bar where users can enter the name of a city they want to know the weather for. After typing the city name and clicking the "Search" button, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions for the specified location. With a beautiful photo of the said city will be displayed in the background.The weather app is a practical, informative, and well-designed application that allows users to obtain real-time weather updates for cities worldwide.
